        <p>The Green Towers Hotel brand is driven by the research and implementation of green initiatives at each hotel, resulting in myriad environmental efforts.</p>
        <p>Lighting saves more than 80 percent on lighting-related energy costs. Eco-friendly pump dispensers top our luxury bath amenities — reducing landfill waste by up to 97 percent over conventional bath amenity packaging. Our 100 percent compostable breakfastware includes cups, lids, cutlery, straws and dishes, while each hotel works with their local waste management company to create a customized recycling program.</p> 
        <p> A special thanks goes to you, our guests — with every stay, you help us make a difference in our environmental footprint, one step at a time.</p>
